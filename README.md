# wÖrter

This is a simple project that I have built for myself. I am currently learning German and I wanted to create something that would help my language learning process, specifcally when it comes to learning vocabulary.

The wÖter app helps me: 

-Add a new word to the vocab list
-save the list
-remove the words I have already learned

It is very simple and I am planning to add more features as I learn more about JS and the different libraries out there.
